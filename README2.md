  # Budget Tracker
  ## Project Description
  A simple progressive web application in the form of a budget tracker which allows for offline access and functionality. The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without network connectivity. Upon reestablishment of network connectivity, a window alert informs the user the stored transactions have been sent to the MongoDB database successfully. Incorporates technologies/APIs like IndexedDB, MongoDB, Express.js, Cache API, Service Workers, and Heroku.
